Please do not mind the poorly written code (no subroutines; no documentation). I was in a terrible hurry to establish proof of concept in order to provide more evidence for the hypothesis "linguistics improvs statistical classification". I use Stanf. parser-generated SVO triples as input vocabulary for the knn algorithm. This implies 'dimensionality reduction' and a balance between statistical and symbolic NLP.
